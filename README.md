## Project Report
ABSTRACT   
Real Time Strategy (RTS) games haven’t had a ton of networking innovation since the creation of lockstepping. For the most part lockstepped RTS games haven’t required new networking strategies. This is still true today. However with the recent blow up of the battle royale genre, it left me thinking a massive player count RTS game would be really neat. There has never been a massively multiplayer RTS game such as starcraft or company of heroes. (At least that I am aware of.) While this may be in part due to design challenges, another important factor is the scalability of a lockstepped system. RTS games require hundreds to thousands of units for each player. You can imagine how adding a new player then leads to syncing massive amounts of information across players devices. For this paper it has two key points of focus. The first is my newly proposed state based streaming via a cloud gaming solution. The second topic of focus is the application of my state based streaming cloud gaming solution to the RTS genre which I have called cloudstepping.
